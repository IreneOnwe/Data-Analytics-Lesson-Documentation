# Data-Analytics-Lesson-Documentation
This project was carried out as an assignment during my learning journey at Harvoxx Tech Hub. 

I learnt how to use Excel to clean data and how to visualise using PowerBi.

## Project Topic: Renee's Restaurant Sales Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze sales performance data from a retail or food service business to uncover trends, performance metrics, and insights that can guide strategic decisions. The data includes key elements such as daily orders, sales totals, item-specific performance, payment method distribution, and monthly order patterns. Through systematic analysis, the goal is to identify top-selling items, preferred payment methods, sales trends over time, and areas for potential improvement.

### Data Sources: The data used for this analysis is a sales dataset gotten from the institution where i was learning- Harvoxx Tech Hub

### Tools Used: 
- Microsoft Excel – For data cleaning.
- Power BI – For interactive visualizations and dashboard creation.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

Starting off with the project, the following action was carried out;
- Data Loading and Inspection
- Check for missing values
- Cleaning of duplicates and formatting
- Data Type Conversion: Dates were converted to proper datetime formats, numeric values were cast for mathematical analysis.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis:

  Key insights from the analysis include:
- Sales Trends Over Time: Identified peak and low periods in sales and orders.
- Top-Performing Menu Items: Highlighted the most frequently ordered and highest-earning items.
- Monthly Patterns: Noted increased sales during festive seasons and weekends.
- Payment Preferences: Analyzed customer preference for payment methods; for example, Card payments dominated while Cash usage declined.
- Order Volume vs. Revenue: Compared order count with total revenue to assess value per order.

  ### Key Performance Indicators
- Total Revenue Sum of all sales across the dataset
-  Average Daily Sales: Mean revenue generated per day
-  Average Order Value: (AOV) Total Sales ÷ Total Number of Orders
-  Revenue by Payment: Method Share of total revenue by payment channel
-  Monthly Sales Growth Rate Percent change in revenue month-over-month

  ### Visualization 
  

  ### Recommendations
  Based on the analysis, the following was recommended;
- Promote High-Performing Items: Consider bundling or offering discounts on best-selling items to increase volume
- Review Low-Performing Menu Items: Either improve, rebrand, or discontinue low-demand items.
- Optimize Payment Systems: If card and digital payments dominate, ensure smooth and secure processing; consider offering incentives for preferred methods.
- Plan for Peak Periods: Staff and stock adequately for high-traffic months or seasons to maximize revenue.
