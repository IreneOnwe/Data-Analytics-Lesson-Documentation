# Data-Analytics-Lesson-Documentation
This project was carried out as an assignment during my learning journey at Harvoxx Tech Hub. 

I learnt how to use Excel to clean data and how to visualise using PowerBi.

## Project Topic: Renee's Restaurant Sales Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze sales performance data from a retail or food service business to uncover trends, performance metrics, and insights that can guide strategic decisions. The data includes key elements such as daily orders, sales totals, item-specific performance, payment method distribution, and monthly order patterns. Through systematic analysis, the goal is to identify top-selling items, preferred payment methods, sales trends over time, and areas for potential improvement.

### Data Sources: The data used for this analysis is a sales dataset gotten from the institution where i was learning- Harvoxx Tech Hub

### Tools Used: 
- Microsoft Excel – For data cleaning.
- Power BI – For interactive visualizations and dashboard creation.

Starting off with the project, the following action was carried out;
- Data Loading and Inspection
